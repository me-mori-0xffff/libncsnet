.TH URL.H 3 "13 June 2024"
.SH NAME
url.h \- contains tools for working with URL specification addresses
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <ncsnet/url.h>
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I <url.h>
provides a convenient interface for working with addresses of the
.B URL
specification,
which, by the way, is approved in the following documents, (
.B RFC 3986, RFC 4248, RFC 4266, RFC 6270, RFC 1738
). The interface in
.B url.h
has almost full support
for them, except for
.B URLs
of the
.B PROSPERO
type, even so, you can hardly
find
.B PROSPERO URLs
anywhere but
.BR RFCs .
.PP
The
.B url_t
structure is used to store addresses, and it is with objects of this structure that all functions of this header work; it looks like this,
.PP
.nf
.ft B
struct url_query     { char *query; char *value; struct url_query *nxt; };
struct url_path      { char *path; struct url_path *nxt; };
struct url_authority { char *host; char *userinfo; char *port; };

typedef struct url_addr
{
  char*                 scheme;
  struct url_authority *authority;
  struct url_path      *path;
  struct url_query     *query;
  char                 *fragment;
  int                   type;
} url_t;

.B NOTE:
to familiarize yourself with the fields you can read the
.B RFC
versions of which were mentioned above, especially
.BR 1738 .
